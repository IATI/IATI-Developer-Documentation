Using the Datastore
--------------------

If you have any problems using the Datastore – whether this is because of bugs, misleading instructions or results – please report these on the mailing list. A collective approach to problem solving will help us get this service up to speed. If you do want to raise an issue privately feel free to mail support@iatistandard.org – but bear in mind that if you think your issue is too ‘dumb’ to raise publicly the chances are the problem lies in our guidance, not your understanding.
