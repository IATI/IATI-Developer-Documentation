IATI Software Deprecation Process
=================================

IATI Software is subject to the `Software Deprecation Process <https://iatistandard.org/documents/10591/IATI_Software_Deprecation_Process.pdf>`__

IATI will follow this process when it comes to deprecating software that it provides.

A deprecated software tool or feature is normally still accessible and usable (except in cases of serious security flaws that necessitate immediate removal) but no longer recommended for use or supported by the owning team. It may or may not be removed eventually from the codebase.


Steps Overview:
---------------

1. **Identification**
2. **Community Research (conditional)**
3. **Planning**
4. **Deprecation Announcement**
5. **Deprecation Period**
6. **Removal Announcement** 
7. **Removal**


Deprecation Support Policy
--------------------------

During the depreciation period we will support existing users transition away from the deprecated software, but we wonâ€™t release bug fixes/enhancements to the deprecated software.
