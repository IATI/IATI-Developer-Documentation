IATI Normative and Non-normative content
========================================

**Normative:** `Normative content <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normative#Standards_documents>`__ is the prescriptive part of a standard. It sets the rules to be followed in order to be evaluated as compliant with the standard, and from which no deviation is permitted. 

The following content is considered normative:

- `IATI SSOT <https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Standard-SSOT>`__

  - `IATI-Codelists <https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Codelists>`__
  
  - `IATI-Rulesets <https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Rulesets/tree/d49b82b821e7ed23d62da1a6767d9dd7cdd310b6>`__
  
  - `IATI-Schemas <https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Schemas/tree/9119bb5fa7d042d81f6cbac9a20970350b723272>`__
  
  - `IATI-Codelists-NonEmbedded <https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Codelists-NonEmbedded>`__

**Non-normative:** Non-normative content is the non-prescriptive, or ‘descriptive’, part of a standard. This may include analogies, synonyms, explanations, illustrations, context, and examples. In the event non-normative content contradicts normative content, the normative content is to be followed. The following content is considered non-normative:

- `IATI-Extra-Documentation <https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Extra-Documentation>`__

- `IATI Guidance <https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Guidance>`__

- `IATI-Developer-Documentation <https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Developer-Documentation>`__

- `IATI-Upgrades <https://github.com/IATI/IATI-Upgrades>`__


In addition to the non-normative content listed above that is related to the standard and managed on Github, IATI also provides `how to publish guidance <https://iatistandard.org/en/guidance/>`__ (managed on Wagtail) which also falls under this category.
