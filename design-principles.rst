Design principles
=================

IATI tools are built on design principles that allow the IATI Technical Team to make effective decisions to help reach our shared goals. IATI tools must therefore be useful, user-driven, inclusive and collaborative, accessible, and open and transparent.

Useful
------

What we do will be valuable to our users:

- by allowing better data to be used to make better decisions
- by being more transparent with their data.

User-driven
-----------

- We strive to adapt to meet user needs.
- We make decisions based on research, testing and evidence.

Inclusive and collaborative
---------------------------

- We strive to include and support anyone who shares IATI’s mission.
- We are a global movement that encourages collaboration.

Accessible
----------

- We will communicate our purpose clearly.
- Our guidance will be consistent and unambiguous.
- Our products will be accessible, intuitive and usable.

Open and transparent
--------------------

- Our vision is to improve the availability of open and transparent data.
- We are open by default – we share what we do.
