Developer Community
===================

Developers can engage with IATI’s diverse technical community to learn, contribute and share best practice. There are different platforms for this, according to context and subject.

- For code-related queries, contributions, bugs, feature requests or other issues, use the corresponding repository in the `IATI's GitHub repositories <https://github.com/IATI>`__. For further information, refer to the :doc:`Developer contributions <contribute>` guidelines.
- For queries related to the IATI Standard itself, and broader discussions involving the rest of the IATI community, use `IATI’s Discuss platform <https://discuss.iatistandard.org>`__.
- For more in-depth queries, email the developers of the IATI Technical Team: code@iatistandard.org.
