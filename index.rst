IATI Developer Documentation
============================

This section contains various pieces documentation targetted at developers interested in using and/or publishing IATI data.

Note that we are in the process of consolidating all developer documentation into this website. Currently, some documentation is still located elsewhere, such as on the `IATI wiki <http://wiki.iatistandard.org/>`_.
