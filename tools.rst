Open source tools: IATI GitHub
==============================

IATI is an open data standard and all internal IATI software tools are open source and available for anyone to use from `IATI's GitHub organisation account <https://github.com/IATI>`__. Please note that some of these repositories are inactive and may exist only for archive purposes. There may be rare instances of code that have yet to make it into IATI's GitHub organisation account, but it is our desire and intention for all IATI code to be there. The following are active repositories.
